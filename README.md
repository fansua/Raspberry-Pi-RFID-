tag so that the information is sent to a Databse. this information is read by a Web application
where the user can register his/her information to the system or the system validates the user card
If the card is acceptablble, a TCP connection is established with another raspberry pi where 
facial recognition is used to validate the person's face
This system also reads temperature data from a sensor and write on to the card.
